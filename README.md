# optc-db.github.io

The Continuation of the highly loved and apreciated OPTC Database that has stopped being updated.

For the beginning I will only update the Database part while figuring out how everything works.
If you want to contribute or work together just shoot me a message on here or through the contact forms in the project itself.
I will also be available on Reddit under Mondfischer

I am also writing a few wiki entries while I figure everything out so feel free to check them out.
